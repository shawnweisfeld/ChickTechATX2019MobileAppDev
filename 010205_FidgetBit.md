## Your Challenge

Make a fidget:bit out of the micro:bit, create a unique output for each of the following inputs:
1. on button A pressed
1. on button B pressed
1. on button A+B pressed
1. on shake

Don't forget that you should:
1. Start by writing pseudocode to plan out what your program should do.
1. Comment your code, so that others can read the code and understand what it does. 
1. Test your code first in the simulator and then on the physical device.
