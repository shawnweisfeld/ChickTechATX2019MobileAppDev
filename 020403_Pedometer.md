# Pedometer Challenge
[Home](./)

Can you turn your micro:bit watch into a pedometer?

## Objective

To count the number of steps you take, a pedemetor uses an accelerometer, like the one in our micro:bit. Use the shake event to count the number of steps you have taken and display. When the user presses the A button it should disply the current number of steps taken, and when the user presses the B button it should reset the counter to zero. Provide feedback to the user after each event so they know that it happened, and don't forget to clear the screen to preserve battery power.
