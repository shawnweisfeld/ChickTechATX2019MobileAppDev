# Stopwatch Challenge
[Home](./)

Can you turn your micro:bit watch into a stopwatch?

## Objective

Your goal is to make a stopwatch. When the user presses the A button it should start counting, when the user presses the B button it should stop counting and display the elapsed time in elapsed min & seconds (i.e. 10 min 5 sec).

> HINT: In the Input toolbox there is a `running time (ms)` block that measures the Number of milliseconds since the program started. (One second is 1000 milliseconds.)
