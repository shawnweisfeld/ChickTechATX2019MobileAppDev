## Activity

Each of you have been given a packet. On the last page fill out the following info, you will have 10 minutes. 

1. Your Name
1. What school you attend
1. What you hope to learn this weekend
1. Something in your every day life that uses computer code that you could not live without

When asked to do so, pair and share what you wrote.  

Now, we will go around the room and you will introduce your buddy.
