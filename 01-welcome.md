## Prizes

During the workshop we will be handing out tickets. We will be giving you tickets when you contribute to the workshop. We will be giving out tickets when you do something awesome. Keep your tickets, and then end of the weekend we will select some tickets at random and give out prizes. The more tickets you earn, the more chances you have to win a prize. 

## Name tents

Take one of the blank pieces of paper in front of you. Fold it in half the long way, and then in half again. Now shape it in a triangle, and write your name on the two visable sides. Then tape it to the table infront of your computer. 

## Getting to know you

Let’s take a few moments to get to know each other!

During this workshop we will be doing some activities in pairs. You will be paired with the person at your table. 

For this exercise the person on the right will be the "interviewer" and you will be interviewing your partner. Take **5 minutes** to ask them the following questions and write your answers down on the paper in front of you. 

- What is your name?
- What school do you go to?
- What technology can you not live without? Why?
- What do you hope to learn at ChickTech?

Now, lets swap roles and interview your partner. You have another **5 minutes**.

Now let’s go around the room and introduce the class to the person you interviewed.
