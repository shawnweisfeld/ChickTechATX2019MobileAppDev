## Prizes

During the workshop we will be handing out tickets. We will be giving you tickets when you contribute to the workshop. We will be giving out tickets when you do something awesome. Keep your tickets, and then end of the weekend we will select some tickets at random and give out prizes. The more tickets you earn, the more chances you have to win a prize. 

## Getting to know you

Let’s take a few moments to get to know each other!

First let’s count off.

Now if you have an EVEN number you will be the "interviewer" and you will be interviewing the person to your right with an ODD number. Take **5 minutes** to ask them the following questions and write your answers down on the paper in front of you. 

- What is your name?
- What school do you go to?
- What technology can you not live without? Why?
- What do you hope to learn at ChickTech?

Now, lets swap roles so ODD number folks are now the interviewers and are answering the questions. You have another **5 minutes**.

Now let’s go around the room and introduce the class to the person you interviewed.
