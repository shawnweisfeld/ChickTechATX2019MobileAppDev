## Design the app

Using the Design worksheet draw what your app will look like. 

Your app shall be able to play music from 4 instruments. You will need a button to start playing each instrument and another to stop playing each instrument (8 total). The start buttons will each have a picture representing the instrument. The stop buttons will be a red circle with the word "STOP" in it.
